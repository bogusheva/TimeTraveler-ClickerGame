# Time Traveler Clicker Game

This is my test case for TechFabric.
You can see it [here](time-traveler.netlify.app).

## Game (test) requirements

Task is to create a Clicker game using JavaScript with the following requirements:

1. The game should have a registration form that collects the user's name and email address. The form should include basic validation to ensure that both fields are not empty and correct email input.
2. The game should have 5 levels, and the player should be able to progress to the next level by reaching a target number of clicks for each level.
3. Each level should have a different enemy (or even theme).
4. The game should keep track of the player's score, which is the total number of clicks they have made across all levels. The score should be displayed on the screen at all times.
5. The game should have a button that the player can click to earn points. Each click should add one point to the player's score.
6. When the player reaches the target number of clicks for a level, a message should be displayed on the screen congratulating them on reaching the next level.
7. The game should be hosted on GitHub so that other people can play it and review your code.
